# Data exploration on Covid-19 cases around the world

This data analysis project centers around COVID-19, examining the number of infections, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and time periods. The project involved using a variety of SQL skills, including Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types.

To start, I imported a large table containing global COVID-19 data into SQL Server and split it into two separate tables. The first table focused on the number of infections and deaths per country across the entire pandemic, while the second table focused on the number of vaccinations given each day.

Using my SQL skills, I performed a variety of data transformations and explorations on both tables. I used Joins to combine the two tables and analyze the relationship between vaccinations and COVID-19 outcomes. I also utilized CTE's, Temp Tables, and Windows Functions to filter and aggregate the data based on different time periods, such as daily or weekly intervals.

In addition, I used Aggregate Functions to summarize the data and create visualizations that highlight the most affected countries and time periods. I also created Views to simplify complex queries and speed up analysis.

Through these explorations, I was able to identify patterns and trends in the COVID-19 data, such as the impact of vaccination campaigns on reducing infections and deaths in certain countries. These insights can help inform public health policy and future pandemic planning efforts.

Overall, this project showcases the power of SQL in data analysis and demonstrates how these specific skills can be applied to explore complex datasets and uncover valuable insights.
